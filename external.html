	<p> There are numerous advantages for External CSS. </p>
	<p> One of the main ones being the fact that you have full control of page structure and
	helps keeps your website and content seperate. </p>
	<p> There are however a few limitations concerning External CSS.
	You have to be careful when it comes to adding in lost of styles as the more there are, the longer it takes to load the page. </p>
	<p> They also are a little dificult to manage, as they don't delete when you delete the page. This makes it quite hard to tell what
	styles are in use. This can be fixed by maintaining the styles page as you go along. </p>
