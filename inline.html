	<p> Arguably, the weakest form of CSS. 	</p>
	<p> It is still useful, but the others have more advantageous traits. </p>
	<p> It's mostly used for testing, as it keeps the load times quick and is on the same document as 
	the rest of the HTML not on a seperate document. </p>

<!-- The alt part in that will come up if the image can't load for some reason. It will also be read out
if a user has a program that reads out whats on the screen. -->
