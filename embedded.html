<div id="profile"><h1> Embedded CSS </h1>
	<p> Embedded CSS is all about, well... embedding styles into things. You embed it into the 'Head' container.	</p>
	<p> Styles that are put in like this, hold more power than if the style was coming from a linked style sheet. 	</p>
	<p> Just like other types of CSS, it supports media queries.	</p>
	<p> There really aren't that many limitations with Embedded styles. Unlike Inline styles where
	it isn't possible to style psuedo-elements and classes, Embedded can do it with ease. It doesn't
	even require a web-designer to do most things.
