	<p> CSS is effective not only on the standard PC, but also on mobiles. </p>
	<p> By using media queries you can manipulate what the page looks like on mobiles. 
	 Not only on mobiles, but tablets too. The program reacts too the change in screen ratio or size and
	 changes what appears on the page. The most common use of this is to change the main layout of the page
	 so that it's more touch friendly.</p>
